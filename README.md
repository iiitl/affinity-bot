# **Affinity Bot** 🤖
Affinity Bot is a powerful and customizable Discord bot designed for seamless interaction and automation within the Affinity Discord server. Built using modern tools and technologies, it leverages **Rust** for high performance and safety and **Shuttle** for effortless deployment.

---
## **Features** ✨
- 🔧 **Moderation Tools**: Manage your server with commands like kick, ban, mute, and more.
- 📚 **Utility Commands**: Fetch information, set reminders, and more!
- ⚡ **High Performance**: Rust-based backend ensures speed, reliability, and memory safety.
- 🚀 **Serverless Deployment**: Leveraging Shuttle for efficient and scalable hosting.

## 🚀 High-Performance Architecture 🔄
The bot leverages Rust's async runtime **Tokio** for efficient parallel processing:
- 🔍 **Price Scraping Engine**: Runs independently in a dedicated async task, continuously monitoring and updating product prices without blocking the main bot operations.
- 📬 **Notification Manager**: Operates in parallel, checking and sending price alerts on configurable intervals. Uses async handlers for processing multiple notifications concurrently.
- ⚡ **Non-Blocking Design**: All database operations and external API calls are fully asynchronous, ensuring optimal resource utilization and responsiveness.
